Online Inventory Management

Most business have many areas to improve their work, especially in their inventory. With the growth of the business, new tactics should be used for increased productivity and improved accuracy. The business we have choosen is a distribution one and has used Excel for a long time but as they have been growing they have come to the conclusion that spreadsheets become outdated very quickly, and theyâ€™re subject to human error and oversight. 
The system we are offering our business gives them more visibility, which allows them to collect real time information on inventory and logistics processes.
